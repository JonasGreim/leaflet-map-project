# Company Headquarters in the USA
The objective of this university project is to demonstrate how the US industry has changed over time, as represented by the major corporate headquarters included in the SP500 or Fortune 500 indices.
The geographical distribution of these headquarters and their respective industry sectors are presented on a map where users can select different years and choose between two indexes.
